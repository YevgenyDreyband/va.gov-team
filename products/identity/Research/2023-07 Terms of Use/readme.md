## Background

With the Terms of Use (TOU), VA would like all users utilizing VA.gov and it's surrounding sites and services to be presented with a unified version of the Terms and Conditions.
Further, we want to be able to track acceptance on a user-by-user basis, including when revisions are made to the terms and conditions and updates are presented to the user.

## Research Goals:
- Explore veterans thinking around terms of use, both in general and as it relates to VA.gov
- Understand how the sign in experience would be affected with a terms of use page interrupting the flow 
- Test the usability of a prototype for updated terms of use
