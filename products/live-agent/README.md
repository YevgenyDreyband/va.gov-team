# Live Agent Chat Discovery and Proof of Concept
Live Agent Chat refers to any system or program where a veteran interacts with VA through a chat interface, whether that is through mobile, web-based or other means. The Thoughtworks team will partner with VES, Seamless CX leaders, and VA Call Center stakeholders to explore how integrations of chat-based Live Agent services may enhance and enable the experiences of Veterans and their caregivers while interacting with the VA.

Problem to solve
================
Veteran-facing chat based communications are primarily administered through our 44 contact centers that cover a wide range of topics from claims, benefits, medical care, etc. Given the wide variance of size and maturity of the various contact centers, decisions around which chat technologies to adopt are happening idependently. While there have been efforts to streamline telephony systems such as the multi-year Enterprise Contact Center Council, chat adoption at VA is still relatively new. 

As more contact centers adopt chat, it is critical to understand the landscape of chat currently in use at VA, and use our research to make recommendations on how to shape the future adoption of chat.

Phase 1 Summary - Discovery
===========================
The first phase is a two month discover effort that runs from mid-June to mid-August 2023. The goals of the discovere effort are to:
-   Understand the existing landscape of chat at the VA including any existing programs, pilots, or planned projects (i.e. VA Solid Start, eBenefits Help Desk)
-   Review the existing technical landscape for chat around CRMs (Microsoft, Salesforce, CxDW, etc) and chat platforms (CirrusMD, eGain, etc)
-   Conduct user research with both veterans and chat live agents to better understand experiences using our chat tools, and chat technology more generally
-   Communicate with program (i.e. eBenefits) and product teams (AskVA, mobile app) around potential future integrations. Examples include: Going from a chatbot to a live agent chat | transferring from one contact center to another, etc.

FINDINGS FROM PHASE 1

Phase 2 (Ongoing) - Design Concept Testing
=======================
In Phase 2, the Design and Test phase, the Thoughtworks Team will begin creation of the Live Agent Proof-of-Concept and publish findings in a finalized version of the Strategic Plan.

**Proof-of-Concept Design**
-  Creating recommendations for a Live Agent Strategic Plan based on our findings
-  Using the draft Strategic Plan as a guide, conduct a Technical Evaluation, Discoverability and Feasibility Study with the goal of building a Live Agent Prototype.
-    Based on our phase 1, our plan is to test a hypothesis of creating a data product, with the goal of gathering better metrics and data portability. This is in service of collecting information from our disparate chat systems into one place so we can make more informed decisions on creating new chat programs, staffing, and improvements to our existing chat experience.

**Proof-of-Concept Test**
Depending on the prototype progress, if appropriate
-  Performing usability tests with
-    Contact Center agents (internal)
-    Veterans (external)

**Finalize Live Agent Strategic Plan**
-  Gather and consolidate Phase 2 findings and finalize the Strategic Plan, including a platform recommendation and Next Steps 


Phase 3 Summary - Beyond Pilot+
=========================
Currently the project is only slated for two phases, however the work completed should be used to inform future decisions around new pilot programs, integrations with other technology products (i.e. chatbot), and more consistent data collection and experience across our various existing and future chat platforms.


Working list of documents to collect
=========================
- Our initial whitepaper
- Various murals created for the project
- Diagrams from our murals (lean value true, user journeys)
- Raw notes from Gene's document
- Links to other useful research, some from Mural some from Sharepoint/OneDrive
- Deck & Doc once finalized
- More to come
