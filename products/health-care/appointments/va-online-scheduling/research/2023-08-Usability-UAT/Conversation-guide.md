## **Moderator logistics**


### 2-3 days before the session:



* Review VA Platform's [Research Checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Checklist.1958773011.html#ResearchChecklist-5.Conductsessions).
* Complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study


### Day of the session:



* Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
* Mute your Slack notifications.
* Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).


### Starting the session:



* In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
* In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
* Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
* When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro:


### When the participant joins:

Validate the participant uses the VA Health and Benefits website and get permission for observers to join.



* Thanks so much for joining today. My name is Melissa, very nice to meet you. Today we're going to talk about the website appointments part of VA.gov. Our discussion will help the team understand how to improve the site for Veterans in the future. 
* Before we begin: I have a few people on the team who are interested in listening in to our session as observers. They’re in the virtual waiting room right now. It’s completely fine if you choose to have the session without observers, so let me know what you’d prefer. If it’s ok with you, I’ll have them join. 

_(If the participant agrees, let observers join. Each observer should come off mute and introduce themselves, and then go back on mute with video off.)_


## **Introduction (5 minutes)**



* There are a few things I'd like to mention:
    * There are no right or wrong answers, and I won’t be offended by any opinions you express. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the mobile website and make it work better for everyone.
    * There’s no expectation to provide any personal information. Please feel free to share your thoughts and experiences at the level that’s comfortable for you.
    * This entire session will take no more than 60 minutes. I will keep an eye on the time and try to keep us moving along so that we don’t go over. 
    * The format of the session is that we’ll talk together in the beginning, and then we will move to a part where I’ll ask you to login to your VA.gov account and share your screen. 
    * Finally, is it ok if I record the screen and the audio during our session today? Our team will use this as backup in case we need to refer to to make sure our notes are accurate. The recordings will be destroyed after we do this. 
    * **While we are so very grateful to have you here and get your feedback, the number one priority is making sure you feel comfortable in this session so if for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop. Just let me know at any point if you’re uncomfortable continuing, and we will end.**
* Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?
* Great! Any questions before we continue?
* Ok, I'm going to hit the record button now. 

_Start recording._



* Is it ok if we record this session?


## **Section 1: Warm-Up Questions (5 minutes)**

Before we look at the site, I have a few questions first, as it would be great to learn more about you and how you use the VA for health and benefits.



* What type of device are you joining us on today? 
* What VA services do you currently use?
    * How do you typically access those services? Website, phone call, something else?
* Are there any interactions with the VA that stand out to you (either positive or negative) that they could share?
* How do you usually schedule and manage your VA appointments?


## **Section 2: Login and Screen share (5 minutes)**



* During our session today, I am going to have you imagine a series of Appointment related scenarios using VA.gov. To do this I will neeed you to share your screen. I can walk you through how to start the screen share. \
_[Help participant share screen] \

[Android: Zoom screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/android-start-screen-share)
* Great, I’m seeing your screen. 
* Now, imagine you want to review your appointments on va.gov, show me where you go to login and go ahead and do it. (you can turn recording off if it shows the PW)
