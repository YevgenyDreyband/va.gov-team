# Initiative Brief - Unified Check-in Experience

## Overview

This initiative comprises a number of enhancements to the online check-in applications. These enhancements aim to reduce the confusion among Veterans and staff of the difference between and purpose for the pre-Check-in and check-in workflows. These enhancements consist of a number of planned releases, each of which will help to solve this problem. All enhancements may not necessarily be needed to achieve the desired outcome, which is to increase the use of the online check-in applications. The team will monitor feedback after each release and work with our VA Product Owner to determine when our objective has been achieved.
 
## Outcome Summary
Veterans will have a better understanding of the tasks they need to complete before a health appointment and the differences between the two online check-in applications will become irrelevant.

## Problem
The Modernized Check-In Experience Team has received feedback from Veterans and staff that PCI is confusing. Specifically, the feedback includes:
- Veterans and staff don’t understand the difference between pre-check-in and check-in workflows.
- Many Veterans use the pre-check-in link that was texted to them to initiate check-in on the day of their appointment, which does not actually allow them to check in.
- Some Veterans skip checking in altogether when they arrive at the clinic because they think they’re checked in as a result of completing the pre-check-in process, which in fact does not initiate or complete the online check in process. 

## Desired Outcomes
| Outcome | Ways to Measure |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| Increase in Veteran satisfaction (and reduction in complaints about PCI being too complicated)  | - VSignals<br>- Conduct Veteran and staff interviews at VA facilities<br>- Feedback from the field  |
| Decrease in “too early” VEText responses (which is viewed by Veterans and staff as a frustrating Veteran experience)  | DataDog |
| Increase in repeat users (Veterans) | - Google Analytics (to the extent possible)<br>- CDW (to the extent possible) |
| Increase in overall utilization (specifically completed eCheck-ins)<br><br>E.g., increase in repeat users, capturing new users that typically don't engage with the posters, and converting users that may have abandoned eCheck-in in the past because of business rules.   | - Google Analytics<br>- CDW<br>- DataDog  |
| Decrease in MSA workload (specifically around volume of manual eCheck-ins per day with or without demographics reviewed and time spent helping Veterans with the texting and QR code step) | - Conduct Veteran and staff interviews at VA facilities<br>- Feedback from the field  |

## Measuring Success
